An ideal explanation for a network's decision would deal with
higher-level variables than raw inputs such as pixels. Rather than explaining
a "dog image" by pointing out any individual pixel or even a set of pixels,
an ideal explanation might point "there are four legs here", "there is a dark
nose here"; "there is a floppy ear there"; "there is some curly fur there."
