## Instructions on contributing

*Use `index.html` within a directory for your page.*
For each topic that you are contributing to, you will do your work in a single
directory. For example, when I created a handbook page on "history", I did
all my work in the subdirectory `/src/history`, and I wrote my handbook
page as `/src/history/index.html`.

*Add supporting files in subdirectories.*
Your page should be generously illustrated with images and links to
demonstration code that readers can run.  If you need to add images,
make sure they are compressed (please no larger than 300K per image),
and include them in the `images` subdirectory;
see the examples in `/src/history/images`.  If you need to add python
notebooks, please make them runnable in Google colab and put your
ipynb files in a `colab` subdirectory such as `/src/history/colab`.
If you copy images and programs from elsewhere, from elsewhere, be sure to mention the source in your text.
